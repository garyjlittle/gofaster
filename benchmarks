# Benchmarks

## Benchmarks and workloads
There is no shortage of  benchmarks and workload generators, I group them into the following categories
### IO / Storage Benchmarks - Simulate a particular application or workload
* Application Benchmarks
* JetStress - simulates IO of a Microsoft exchange database server
* Workload Benchmarks
** SFS 97/2008 - simulates the IO workload pattern of an email server
### IO / Storage Workload Generators - Create your own workload pattern
* IOmeter - one of the most well-known, popular with Windows users.  Allows client-server deployment
* vdbench - Java based IO generator, popular due to its configurability. Allows client-server deployment
* fio
* bonnie

## Orchestrators
* HCIbench - orchestrates vdbench.  Can all workloads are uniform (e.g. all VM's run same workload)
* X-Ray - orchestrates fio.  Each VM can run a separate workload, incorporates temporal and failure dimensions


### Application Benchmarks
* HammerDB (Free) - Simulates various database workload patterns.  HammerDB only generates the queries and DB schema, it requires a database engine to connect to.
* Benchmark Factory (Commercial) - Like HammerDB it simulated a variety 

### Virtualization Benchmarks
* VMmark
* SPECVirt
* TPCx-V
* TPCx-HCI

Proof of Concept
路         Intro to different benchmarking tools (, , , , , Vmmark, etc.)
o    Gary Little
o    Conversational/supporting materials
o    Does it have a place in evaluating HCI or not?
路         Installing/configuring X-Ray (not on target cluster, network/DHCP requirements, IPMI requirements, cloning/editing scenarios)
o    Reference product documentation
o    Matt will look for existing install video
路         X-Ray test scenario overview - what each test aims to demonstrate, why are the testing parameters reasonable, what we use to generate workloads, open source/customizable
路         Analyzing X-Ray test results - Speaking to the example X-Ray results for each test, why it looks the way it does, how/why we would (generically) expect competitors to have issues
